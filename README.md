# StealthPatch
Load any patch in Black Ops you want, completely undetected.

Based on [LinkerMod](https://github.com/Nukem9/LinkerMod).

## Install
Instructions not available at this time. However, keep in mind that this will be only available for Steam copies of the game.

## Why?
Why not? It was only a matter of time until someone from outside the community came in and made someting like this.

The rules for Black Ops 1 need to enforce showing game files, and this should give a push for that.

## What Patches are compatible?
Every patch will be compatible, however it is recommended that you use the universal stealth patch.

Whichever patch you choose will have to be named `stealth_patch.ff` in the `zone/Common` folder.
