# StealthPatch
Load any patch for Black Ops that you want, completely undetected.

Based on [LinkerMod](https://github.com/Nukem9/LinkerMod).

## Installation
Extract `stealth_patch.zip` to the root of your Steam game folder, and run `BO_Patch.bat`, this will memory patch your game to load the stealth patches.

## Where do the Universal Stealth Patches go?
They go in the `zone/Common` directory of your Steam game folder.

## What Patches are compatible?
Previously created map patches will work, however it is recommended that you use the universal stealth patch for the map you want to play provided with the [latest release](https://github.com/BlackOpsModding/StealthPatch/releases/latest), they will give the best results.
